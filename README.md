# MockProxy

The easiest way to proxy HTTP/HTTPS requests from your application to any APIs endpoint

Given the initial idea of mocking data needed for an application, currently GET method is supported _only_

## How to use

1.  [Here](https://mockproxy.herokuapp.com/documentation/) it's available the Swagger documentation
1.  Perform a `POST` request to `/api/v1/{mp_key}` endpoint to create a new key

        curl -X POST \
        https://mockproxy.herokuapp.com/api/v1/jsonplaceholder \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{
        	"basePath":"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
        	}'

1.  Begin using `mockproxy` as the public API for your just created key above to retrieve (and store) mock data

        curl -X GET \
        https://mockproxy.herokuapp.com/api/v1/jsonplaceholder/comments
